			"title": "The Habit of Relationship",
			"core_habit": "Spend the first hour of your morning alone with God",
			"overview": "A.W. Tozer wrote, 'What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.' If this is true, then the biggest problem in your life is not your finances, your job, or your relationships. Your biggest problem is an unhealthy relationship with God. As the Author of existence and the source of all good things, He alone can fulfill the longings within us and direct our steps to all that is life-giving. But only if we allow Him the space to do so. Brother Lawrence, a 17th century monk, said, 'All spiritual life consists of practicing God's presence, and that anyone who practices it correctly will soon attain spiritual fulfillment.' The challenge with loving God is that He is not like anyone else you know. To actually love Him, you must practice giving your full attention to Him and methodically reprogram your thoughts about Him and your desires for Him. This is why daily time alone, seeking God, is one of the most crucial habits in your life.",
			"implementation": "The habit of seeking God has four important elements: time, attention, the Bible, and prayer. First, you must set aside time to seek God. If this is a new habit for you, begin by setting aside the first 15 minutes of your day's full attention for God. If you have practiced this habit for a while, target one hour every morning. One hour is long enough to completely disrupt your routine but short enough to actually be possible with some sacrifice.",
			"soap_method": {
				"description": "Approaching your time with God by meditating on His word, the Bible, can be a little intimidating, especially if this is new for you. Here is a very simple approach to help get the most out of your first hour with God. We call it S.O.A.P., which stands for Scripture, observe, apply, pray. Through journaling, read Scripture, and process through its truths, how it applies to you, and use it as a prayer guide to talk with God. Like a good shower, there's nothing like starting your day fresh, setting the tone in God's presence.",

		"rhythm": {
			"section_number": 2,
			"title": "The Habit of Rhythm",
			"core_habit": "Develop weekly rhythms to be healthy emotionally, mentally, and physically",
			"overview": "The faith world is often not a place where holistic health is considered. We hear a lot about getting your heart and soul right with God, but what about the rest of you? Inadvertently, our emphasis on the soul and our eternal reality, has often done injustice to the whole person God created by separating the value of our soul from our body. Quite literally, we can be 'so heavenly minded, that we're no earthly good.' But God has created this whole physical world 'very good' and designed us to worship him with our entire selves, mind, body, soul, and spirit (see Mark 12:30).",
			"holistic_principle": "Because we are holistic and multifaceted beings, how we live in one area of our self will have an impact on every other area. We cannot be fully healthy in one area if we are not healthy in the others. Your IQ in bible knowledge may be high, but that does not mean you know how to control your anger. Quite honestly, poor emotional health will negatively impact how you see the world and interpret truth. Similarly, if we are not physically healthy, we will struggle with the energy to care for people. We cannot separate one aspect of our self from the others. We are integrated selfâ€”mind, soul, emotions, and body. God designed us to worship him by being healthy in every area of our life.",

		"reconciliation": {
			"section_number": 3,
			"title": "The Habit of Reconciliation",
			"core_habit": "Commit to gathering weekly with believers in large and small groups",
			"overview": "God did not design us to live life in isolation. There is a reason solitary confinement is one of the harshest punishments. God created us to thrive in a committed, sacrificial, and caring circle of relationships as we live on mission together. Yet, our modern Western world has conditioned us more towards isolation and loneliness than ever before. Each decade, the average number of reported close friends continues to decline, with over half of Americans feeling regularly lonely and as many as 40% feeling chronically lonely. Even for all the digital 'friends' and connections through 'social' media and other virtual opportunities, stats show a sharp decline in meaningful, secure attachments in relationships. Great Britain even has a 'loneliness minister' to attend to this Western crisis!",
			"church_context": "The church is not void of this trend either. Church attendance has dropped all across the Western world. Even those who merely attend church, without meaningful connections throughout the week, tend to do so less often. Bottom line: we live in a culture with many lonely and disconnected people. But Jesus calls us to something higher. His context for personal transformation is community. And not just any community, but a radical community committed to sharing life at deep, sacrificial levels. This is the alternative community Jesus envisioned and gave his life for to utterly change the world.",
			"radical_community": "With this in mind, our third COST habit must follow Jesus into His rhythms of life together. There is no other way to experience Jesus' abundant life fully without intentionally choosing to live His kind of life together with others who are also following Him. To become love, we must embrace the fact that love has a context: relationships. For those who say, 'Who needs the church? I can practice my faith on my own,' they have missed the core of what it means to become love. We cannot practice love without community.",
			"meeting": {

		"radiance": {
			"section_number": 4,
			"title": "The Habit of Radiance",
			"core_habit": "Share your faith every week",
			"overview": "Most of us love comfort. We want comfortable clothes, comfortable furniture, and comfortable conversations. We even prefer comfort foods. Comfort has become such a priority in our culture that it deeply influences what we are willing to think or talk about. Although there is not necessarily anything wrong with outward comforts, Jesus calls us higher. Combine this with a cultural pressure to keep faith a private dealâ€”'believe whatever you want, just don't force it on me'â€”and it leaves many hesitant to share their faith with others.",
			"cultural_statistics": "In fact, only half of Christians have more than two conversations about faith each year, and 38% of adults identifying as Christians do not have a friend or family member who does not identify as a Christian. But this is not the way of Jesus! As you grow in the first few habits, you will likely discover God's love compelling you to share His love with others.",
			"spirit_compulsion": "You will find yourself interacting with others who are far from God, and the Spirit of Jesus will tug on your soul. How can you stand by and say nothing? How can you watch your friend or your neighbor struggle without a living relationship with God? As God's love grows within you, it will push you beyond what is comfortable. But, how do you effectively share your faith? How do you engage those around you in spiritual conversations? There is no perfect method, but there is a perfect motive. It must begin with love.",
			"practical_approach": "Out of a heart of love, you can grow in sharing your faith every week. You might read this and think, 'Share my faith once a week? Are you serious? I don't share my faith once a year!' Maybe this seems unrealistic right now, but let me assure you, you can do this. Start moving out in this direction and God will meet you, opening unexpected doors and standing with you even when you feel unqualified. As you learn to pray for those in your sphere of influence who do not yet believe, listen well, share time with them, and serve them, God will open doors to share the hope of Jesus and His work of grace in your life.",

		"response": {
			"section_number": 5,
			"title": "The Habit of Response",
			"core_habit": "Serve someone daily and your church twice a month",
			"overview": "Serving others is not a side project of the Christian life â€” it is the Christian life. From Genesis to Revelation, the arc of Scripture reveals a God who stoops to serve, culminating in the sacrificial love of Jesus Christ. When we serve others, we are not merely doing good; we are embodying the very heart of the gospel. First, serving others is a biblical priority. Jesus taught His disciples that greatness in the kingdom is not measured by position, but by posture â€” the posture of a servant. In John 13, when Jesus washed the disciples' feet, He said plainly, 'I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you' (v.15). In that moment, He shattered every hierarchy and made service the defining mark of His followers.",
			"gospel_response": "Second, serving is our faithful response to Jesus' sacrifice for us. The gospel is not just something we believe; it's something we become. Jesus didn't just save us from something â€” He saved us for something. His humility and love compel us, as 2 Corinthians 5:14 puts it, to 'no longer live for ourselves but for him who died for us.' Third, serving others is a credible witness to the world. In an age obsessed with self, service stands out. Jesus said in John 13:35, 'By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.' When love becomes visible through service, it points others to the invisible Savior.",
			"real_difference": "Finally, serving others makes a real difference. Galatians 5:13 calls us to 'serve one another humbly in love,' and when we do, we become living proof that God's kingdom is already breaking into the world. Service lifts the lowly, meets needs, binds wounds, and offers hope. It changes the world, one act of obedience at a time.",
			"stott_quote": "As John Stott put it: 'The authority by which the Christian leader leads is not power but love, not force but example, not coercion but reasoned persuasion. Leaders have power, but power is safe only in the hands of those who humble themselves to serve.' In a world hungry for meaning and desperate for hope, there may be no louder sermon than a life laid down in love. To follow Jesus is to follow Him to the basin and the towel â€” and from there, to the lives of others.",
			"meeting": {
				"title": "Every Gift",
				"scripture": "1 Corinthians 12:4-31",
				"introduction": "Reflect on the image of a body with many parts. What is the overall picture Paul is painting about the various gifts God has given us and their purpose?",
				"key_concepts": [
					"Every person has unique gifts from God",
					"Gifts are for serving others, not personal recognition",
					"Stewardship vs. ownership of abilities",
					"Service as response to Christ's love",
					"Authentic faith revealed through action"

					"What is the danger of 'gift comparison?' What warnings do you see in this passage?",
					"Paul clarifies that no one is a mistake - 'God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.' Is this easy or hard to accept?",

		"resistance": {
			"section_number": 6,
			"title": "The Habit of Resistance",
			"core_habit": "Connect weekly with an accountability partner to set boundaries, resist temptations and replace them with living by God's design",
			"overview": "In our culture, we are bombarded with the narrative of self-fulfillment at all costs. 'Do whatever makes you happy' and 'follow your heart,' are common phrases. This is how our culture defines true freedom: the absence of constraints to pursue happiness for your authentic self. Yet if we follow the path of 'I'm free to do whatever I want,' and never resist our desires, will it actually lead us to the happiness we are longing for? The reality is that our desires, unchecked, will always lead us astray. Unrestrained desire for food will leave us physically unhealthy. Unrestrained desire for digital feedback on mobile devices will leave us addicted and not present. And unrestrained sexual desires will inevitably lead to regret and shame.",
			"spiritual_resistance": "So what's our solution? Spiritual resistance. The Bible calls it self-control, a mastery of the self and our desires, submitting them to Jesus and learning how to say 'no' to lesser desires to find true fulfillment in Jesus alone. Tim Keller once said, 'Real freedom comes from a strategic loss of some freedoms in order to gain others. It is not the absence of constraints but it is the choosing the right constraints and the right freedoms to lose.'",
			"cost_of_discipleship": "This does not mean it will be easy. Dietrich Bonhoeffer once said, 'When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.' Yes, the cost of discipleship is a high bar, but have we considered the cost of non-discipleship? If we do not have a way of resisting our immediate urges, the cost of not following Jesus will always be harder, leaving us more enslaved than before. God's plan for us is not to restrict, but to give life. But we must embrace His boundaries through self-control if we are to truly experience this life.",
			"accountability_necessity": "Here's the key: you cannot do this on your own! We're too selfish to see our own blindspots and too weak to will ourselves into obedience. That's where accountability comes in. To practice the habit of resistance, we all have to not only identify our temptations and unhealthy addictions, but develop regular accountability relationships in our lives to help us resist.",
			"meeting": {
				"title": "Self-Control",
				"scripture": "Titus 2:11-14",
				"introduction": "How do we encounter the love of God in this passage? What is He offering us as He invites us to live a life of resistance?",
				"key_concepts": [
					"Grace empowers us to say no to ungodliness",
					"Self-control requires replacing temptations with higher purposes",
					"Sexual purity and God's design for sexuality",
					"Confession and accountability break sin's power",
					"Resurrection power enables new desires"

			"core_habit": "Structure your stewardship around priority, percentage, and progressive giving",
			"overview": "What makes you feel secure? What makes you feel important? What gives you a sense of control? For many of us, there is one thing that informs our sense of security, our sense of worth, and our feeling of control: money. According to Scripture, having money is not sin. Money provides certain opportunities, and can be a great tool in God's hand. What is dangerous is a reliance on money, treating it as a false salvation. Those with any degree of wealth will inevitably struggle with the mirage of self-sufficiency and security (See Mark 10:17-27).",
			"stewardship_mindset": "How do we live free from an unhealthy attachment to money, and instead, develop healthy attachments to God? First, we must change how we see ourselves. We are not owners of our life and things. We are stewards, entrusted by God to help manage the life and resources He has given us for His purposes. In this, we must learn to trust Him with our money through priority giving, percentage giving, and progressive giving.",
			"giving_principles": {
				"priority_giving": "Priority Giving: God teaches us to trust him by commanding us to give our first and our best (Matthew 6:33). When we give last, after all the bills are paid and the needs are met, there is no faith involved in the transaction. But when we give first, before any of our needs are met, we declare God as our source, our safety, and our provider!",
				"percentage_giving": "Percentage Giving: Generosity looks different for every person (see the woman and her copper coins in the temple in Luke 21:1â€“4). Each person must wrestle with the question, 'How much would I have to give in order to detach my heart from trusting in things and attach my heart fully to God?' Scripture introduces the principle of the tithe (giving 10 percent of my income) as a starting place to teach our hearts to trust him.",
				"progressive_giving": "Progressive Giving: Like all areas in your spiritual life, God wants you to grow and stretch over time. Progressive giving means that you regularly assess your standard of living and your standard of giving, inviting God into the assessment and allowing your heart to stay in a place of dependence and faith. This leads to the seventh COST Habit."
